# Intro
<br/>
Hello there! One and a half year in the IT. I am currently working as a frontend developer in a web studio named *Flag* in Ekaterinburg. Studied on my own. Reading books, exploring YouTube, solving codewars tasks. And off course I did educational projects such us to-do-list or flag-tz. You can check it in my GitHub account. In 2022 I made 3 reports for my colleagues. Themes was: "css grid", "optimization", "vue3".<br/>
Self learning continues to this day. I try to always learn something new and improve what I already know.

# Skills
<br/>
 - JavaScript
 - TypeScript
 - Vue
 - CSS, SCSS
 - HTML off cource
 - Bash
 - A little bit C
 - Git in terminal (i really love git and enjoy working in terminal)
 - Webpack
 - BEM methodology
 - Some patterns like State, Builder, Strategy and other...

Code examples you can check in my GitHub and Codewars account ;)
